# Phase 4 Implementation Summary: Dashboard & Session Views

## Overview

Phase 4 of the Poker Stats application has been successfully implemented, providing comprehensive dashboard views for both casual players and admins, along with session history and detail pages. The implementation follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, with a focus on clean separation between domain logic, application services, and presentation layers.

## DDD & Clean Code Principles Applied

### ✅ Domain-Driven Design

1. **Domain Service (StatsCalculator):**
   - Pure business logic, no framework dependencies
   - Complex calculations that don't belong to a single entity
   - Value objects for immutable statistics snapshots
   - Follows "Tell, Don't Ask" principle

2. **Application Service (DashboardService):**
   - Orchestration layer between domain and presentation
   - Coordinates multiple repositories and domain services
   - Thin layer with no business logic

3. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - Domain layer: Business rules and calculations
   - Application layer: Use cases and orchestration
   - Infrastructure layer: API controllers and persistence
   - Presentation layer: React components

### ✅ Clean Code

1. **Meaningful Names:**
   - `StatsCalculator`, `PlayerStats`, `SystemStats`
   - `formatProfitCents`, `formatROI`, `formatStreak`
   - Self-documenting code

2. **Single Responsibility:**
   - Each component has one clear purpose
   - Utility functions are focused and reusable
   - Services have clear boundaries

3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):**
   - Reusable `StatsCard` component
   - Centralized formatting utilities
   - Shared API client

4. **Type Safety:**
   - Full TypeScript typing
   - Interface definitions matching backend DTOs
   - No `any` types used

## Statistics Calculations

### Player Statistics

1. **Net Profit:** `Total Cash-Out - Total Buy-In`
2. **ROI (Return on Investment):** `(Net Profit / Total Buy-In) × 100`
3. **Win Rate:** `(Winning Sessions / Total Sessions) × 100`
4. **Current Streak:** Calculated by traversing recent sessions:
   - Positive number = winning streak
   - Negative number = losing streak
   - Zero = no streak or break-even

### System Statistics

1. **Total Sessions:** Count of all non-deleted sessions
2. **Active Sessions:** Count of sessions without end time
3. **Total Players:** Count of all active players
4. **Total Money in Play:** Sum of all buy-ins across all sessions
