## Game Sessions

### How are sessions added?

Only admins can log game sessions. After each game, an admin enters:
- Session details (date, location, game type)
- All players who participated
- Buy-in and cash-out amounts for each player

### Why can't I add my own sessions?

To maintain data accuracy and prevent disputes. Having a single trusted admin log all sessions ensures consistency and fairness.

### When will I see a session I just played?

Immediately after the admin logs it! Stats update in real-time.

### Can I view sessions I didn't participate in?

No. For privacy, you can only see sessions you were part of.

### What if there's an error in a session?

Contact your admin. They can edit sessions to correct mistakes.

### How far back does session history go?

All sessions ever logged are preserved. There's no time limit on historical data.

## Statistics

### How is net profit calculated?

Simple addition across all your sessions:
```
Net Profit = Total Cash-Outs - Total Buy-Ins
```

Example:
- Session 1: +$50
- Session 2: -$20
- Session 3: +$30
- **Net Profit: $60**

### What is ROI and how is it calculated?

ROI (Return on Investment) measures efficiency:
```
ROI = (Net Profit / Total Buy-Ins) √ó 100%
```

Example:
- Total Buy-Ins: $1,000
- Net Profit: $200
- **ROI: 20%**

This means you make $20 profit for every $100 you invest.

### What is win rate?

The percentage of sessions where you had a profit:
```
Win Rate = (Winning Sessions / Total Sessions) √ó 100%
```

Example:
- Total Sessions: 10
- Winning Sessions: 6
- **Win Rate: 60%**

### Why is my ROI negative?

You've lost more money than you've invested. A negative ROI means you're currently down overall. This is normal in poker due to variance - keep playing and focus on improving!

### How many sessions do I need for accurate stats?

**Minimum**: 10 sessions for basic trends  
**Recommended**: 20+ sessions for meaningful statistics  
**Ideal**: 50+ sessions for reliable long-term indicators

Early statistics will be volatile due to small sample size.

### What's a good win rate?

It depends on your group, but generally:
- **30-40%**: Below average (but not bad for tough games)
- **40-50%**: Average
- **50-60%**: Above average
- **60%+**: Excellent

Remember: In poker, the goal is net profit, not just high win rate!

### What's a good ROI?

Again, it varies, but typical ranges:
- **0-10%**: Breakeven to slight profit
- **10-20%**: Good performance
- **20-30%**: Very good
- **30%+**: Excellent (or small sample size!)

### Why don't buy-ins match cash-outs in a session?

Common reasons:
- Dealer tips or host fees
- Food/drink expenses taken from pot
- Rounding differences
- Players leaving early with chips
- Data entry errors (rare)

Small discrepancies ($1-$5) are normal and acceptable.

## Leaderboards

### How are leaderboards calculated?

Leaderboards rank players by different metrics:
- **Total Profit**: Sum of all profit/loss
- **ROI %**: Return on investment percentage
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of winning sessions
- **Current Streak**: Consecutive wins/losses

### Why am I not on the leaderboard?

You need at least **5 sessions** to appear on leaderboards. This prevents skewed statistics from limited data.

### Can I see all-time leaderboards?

Yes! The default view shows all-time statistics. You can filter by date range if the feature is available.

### Why did my leaderboard position change?

Your position updates after every session logged. If others played and you didn't, they might have moved up. Keep playing to climb!

### Who can see the leaderboard?

All users can see the leaderboard, but it only includes players from sessions they've participated in. You can't see stats from games you weren't part of.

- Session deletion (contact admin)

### My stats seem wrong

First, verify:

3. Do the individual session results look correct?

If still incorrect, contact your admin with specific examples.

### Charts won't load

## Miscellaneous

### What currency does Poker Stats use?

**Default**: PLN (Polish Zloty)

The currency is configured by the system administrator. All amounts in the system use the same currency.

### Can I track multiple poker groups?

Currently, Poker Stats is designed for one group per installation. For multiple groups, you'd need separate instances.

### Can we use this for tournaments?

Yes! Log tournament results as:
- **Buy-in**: Tournament entry fee
- **Cash-out**: Prize won (or 0 if eliminated)
- Add a note specifying tournament format

### What about cash games vs tournaments?

The app treats everything as cash game equivalents (buy-in and cash-out). You can note the format in session notes.

### Can we split the pot (multiple winners)?

Each player records their individual result. If multiple players profit, that's fine - just record accurate buy-in and cash-out for each.

### How do rake/tips work?

Record the actual amounts players bought in and cashed out. If there's a rake or tips, this will create a natural discrepancy (total cash-outs slightly less than total buy-ins). This is normal!
