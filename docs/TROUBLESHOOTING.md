## Performance Issues

### App is Slow

**Symptoms**: Pages take long to load, actions are delayed

**Diagnosis:**
```
Check what's slow:
- [ ] Initial page load
- [ ] Navigating between pages
- [ ] Loading stats/charts
- [ ] Submitting forms
```

**Solutions:**
```
1. Check internet speed
   - Run speed test (speedtest.net)
   - Required: 2+ Mbps download

2. Close other tabs/apps
   - Free up system resources

3. Clear browser cache
   - Old cached data can slow things down

4. Check server load (Admin)
   - View Grafana dashboard
   - Check if server is under heavy load

5. Optimize session history
   - Limit date range when viewing sessions
   - Use filters to reduce data loaded
```

### Slow After Many Sessions

**Symptoms**: App was fast initially, now slow

**For Admins:**
```
1. Database optimization
   bash scripts/verify-data-integrity.sh
   - Runs VACUUM ANALYZE

2. Check disk space
   df -h
   - Ensure sufficient space

3. Restart services
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart

4. Check logs
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs backend
   - Look for slow query warnings
```

## Data Issues

### Sessions Not Appearing

**Symptoms**: Recent session doesn't show in history

**Diagnosis checklist:**
```
- [ ] Was the session actually submitted? (Check with admin)
- [ ] Are you looking at the right player?
- [ ] Are filters hiding it?
- [ ] Is date range correct?
```

**Solutions:**
```
1. Clear filters
   - Remove all filters from session list
   - Check "All Time" date range

2. Refresh page
   - Force refresh: Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + R

3. Check with admin
   - Verify session was successfully logged
   - Not just saved as draft

4. Clear browser cache
   - Might be showing old cached version
```

### Stats Don't Match Expectations

**Symptoms**: Numbers seem incorrect

**Diagnosis:**
```
1. Verify individual sessions
   - Click each session
   - Check buy-in and cash-out
   - Verify profit calculation

2. Check date range
   - Are you looking at "Last Month" vs "All Time"?

3. Check filters
   - Are any location/player filters active?

4. Manual calculation
   - Add up a few sessions manually
   - Compare with displayed stats
```

**If Still Wrong:**
```
Contact admin with specifics:
- Which stat is wrong (ROI, Win Rate, Net Profit)?
- Expected value vs displayed value
- Screenshot of stats page
- Links to relevant sessions
```

### Leaderboard Position Incorrect

**Symptoms**: Your rank seems wrong

**Common Causes:**
```
1. Stats just updated
   - Leaderboard recalculates after each session
   - Recent session might have changed rankings

2. Tied with other players
   - Ties broken alphabetically by name

3. Minimum sessions not met
   - Need 5+ sessions to appear on leaderboard

4. Looking at wrong metric
   - Ensure you're viewing correct leaderboard
   - (Profit vs ROI vs Win Rate)
```

## Admin-Specific Issues

### Cannot Submit Session

**Symptoms**: Submit button disabled or errors on submission

**Checklist:**
```
- [ ] At least 2 players selected
- [ ] All required fields filled
- [ ] Buy-in and cash-out entered for all players

- [ ] Internet connection active
```

**Solutions:**
```
1. Check validation errors
   - Red text shows what's wrong
   - Fix highlighted fields

2. Check player count
   - Minimum 2 players required

   - Click "Save Draft"
   - Close browser
   - Reopen and resume from Drafts

4. Check browser console (F12)
   - Look for error messages
   - Share with support
```

### Player Not in List

**Symptoms**: Can't find player when logging session

**Causes:**
- Player is deactivated
- Player was deleted
- Wrong search term

**Solutions:**
```

   - Click "+ Add New Player"
   - Enter player details

3. Check spelling

```

### Session Balance Won't Validate

**Symptoms**: Large discrepancy warning, can't submit

   - $220 vs $22.0
   - Common typo error

2. Verify each player
   - Go through each player one by one
   - Recalculate buy-in and cash-out

3. Account for tips/rake
   - Small discrepancies are OK
   - Add note explaining large ones

4. Skip validation (if truly intentional)
   - Warning can be ignored
   - Add explanation in notes
```

### Draft Not Saving

**Symptoms**: Draft disappears when navigating away

**Solutions:**
```
1. Explicit save
   - Click "Save Draft" button
   - Wait for confirmation message

2. Check local storage
   - Browser might block local storage
   - Enable in browser settings

3. Don't use private mode
   - Incognito/private mode clears data
   - Use normal browser window
```
