## Common Questions

### How do I get added to a session?

The admin logs the session and includes your results. You'll see it automatically appear in your dashboard.

### Can I add my own sessions?

No, only admins can log sessions. This ensures data accuracy and prevents disputes.

### Why don't my buy-ins and cash-outs match?

This is normal! Factors include:
- Tips for the dealer/host
- Food/drink expenses
- Rounding differences
- Late arrivals/early departures

### How is profit calculated?

Simple: `Profit = Cash Out - Buy In`

For a session:
- Buy-in: $100
- Cash-out: $150
- Profit: $150 - $100 = **$50**

### When are stats updated?

Immediately after an admin logs a session. Real-time updates!

### Can I see other players' detailed stats?

You can see:
- ✅ Other players on the leaderboard
- ✅ Their results in sessions you both played
- ❌ Their complete session history
- ❌ Sessions you weren't part of

### What if I notice an error in a session?

Contact your admin to correct it. They can edit sessions to fix mistakes.
