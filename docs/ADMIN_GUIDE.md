## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Player Leaves Early

**Solution:**
- Record their final buy-in and cash-out at time of leaving
- Add a note: "Left at 11 PM"
- This is accurate data - don't estimate what they "would have" won/lost

### Scenario 2: Late Arrival

**Solution:**
- Only record the buy-in/cash-out for the time they actually played
- Note their arrival time if relevant
- Don't include them if they didn't play

### Scenario 3: Missing Cash-Out Information

**Solution:**
- Ask the player before they leave!
- If impossible, make best estimate based on chip count
- Add note: "Approximate - left before count"
- Correct later if you get accurate information

### Scenario 4: Shared Buy-In

**Example**: Two players split a buy-in

**Solution:**
- Record each player individually with their actual stake
- Example:
  - Player A: Buy-in $50, Cash-out $100 ‚Üí Profit $50
  - Player B: Buy-in $50, Cash-out $100 ‚Üí Profit $50
- Not: Single entry for $100

### Scenario 5: Tournament Format

**Solution:**
- Still log as cash game equivalents
- Buy-in = Tournament entry
- Cash-out = Prize money
- Add note: "Tournament - 10 players, top 3 paid"

### Scenario 6: Discovered Error Days Later

**Solution:**
1. Edit the session
2. Correct the error
3. Add a note explaining the correction
4. Notify affected players
5. Stats will recalculate automatically

## FAQs

### How long should logging a session take?

**Typical time: 3-5 minutes** for a session with 6 players if you're prepared.

**Tips to speed up:**
- Have notes ready (write down results during game)
- Use "Duplicate Last Session" for regular games
- Pre-select common location

### Can I bulk import sessions?

Not currently. Each session must be logged individually to ensure accuracy.

### What if two admins log the same session?

**Prevention:**
- Designate one admin to log each session
- Check recent sessions before logging
- If duplicate created, delete one (soft delete)

### Can I delete a session?

Sessions are **soft-deleted**:
- They won't appear in lists
- Stats are recalculated without them
- Can be restored if needed
- Historical data is preserved

### How do I handle cash games vs tournaments?

**Cash Games:**
- Log normally (buy-in and cash-out)

**Tournaments:**
- Buy-in = Entry fee
- Cash-out = Prize won (or 0 if eliminated)
- Add note specifying tournament format

### What's the maximum session size?

**Technical limit**: 100 players (unlikely to reach!)
**Practical limit**: 20-30 players

For very large tournaments, consider:
- Only tracking final table
- Creating multiple sessions
- Using dedicated tournament software

### Can players see edit history?

Currently no. Only admins see "Last edited" timestamp.

### What if a player disputes their results?

1. Listen to their concern
2. Check your records/notes
3. Review the session details
4. Make corrections if they're right
5. Explain if data is accurate
6. Add notes for transparency

## Tips from Experienced Admins

### "Keep a notepad during games"

Write down final buy-in/cash-out for each player as the game ends. Takes 30 seconds, saves 10 minutes of trying to remember later.

### "Use consistent location names"

Create a standard list of location names and stick to them. Makes filtering much easier.

### "Log immediately"

Don't wait until the next day. Memory fades, disputes arise, and you'll forget small details.

### "Screenshots are your friend"

Take a photo of final chip stacks before breaking them down. Evidence if there's a dispute.

### "Communicate changes"

If you edit a session, tell affected players. Transparency builds trust.
