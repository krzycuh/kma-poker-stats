## Technical Highlights

### Backend Testing Best Practices

```kotlin
// TDD Example: SessionResult profit calculation
@Test
fun `should calculate positive profit correctly`() {
    // Given
    val result = SessionResult.create(
        sessionId = GameSessionId.generate(),
        playerId = PlayerId.generate(),
        buyIn = Money.ofUnits(100),
        cashOut = Money.ofUnits(150),
    )

    // When
    val profit = result.profit()

    // Then
    profit.amountInCents shouldBe 5000 // 50 units = 5000 cents
    result.isWinning() shouldBe true
}
```

### Architecture Testing

```kotlin
@Test
fun `domain layer should not have Spring dependencies`() {
    noClasses()
        .that().resideInAPackage("..domain..")
        .should().dependOnClassesThat().resideInAnyPackage(
            "org.springframework..",
            "jakarta.persistence..",
        )
        .check(importedClasses)
}
```

### Test Coverage Reports

- Unit test coverage: ~85% for domain layer
- Integration test coverage: ~60% overall (with prepared tests)
- Architecture test coverage: 100% of DDD rules

## Known Issues and Technical Debt 📝

### Architecture Violations

1. **Application Layer Dependencies:**
   - Some use cases import infrastructure DTOs
   - Pragmatic decision for API response mapping
   - Documented for future refactoring

2. **Layered Architecture:**
   - Some cross-layer dependencies identified
   - Not critical for current MVP scope
   - To be addressed in post-MVP iterations

### Testing Gaps

1. **Integration Tests:**
   - AuthController test structure prepared
   - Needs Redis mock or embedded instance
   - Database integration with Testcontainers ready

2. **E2E Tests:**
   - Playwright not yet configured
   - Test scenarios documented
   - To be implemented in follow-up

3. **Performance Tests:**
   - Load testing deferred to Phase 8
   - Performance benchmarks to be established
