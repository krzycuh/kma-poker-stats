### Type Definitions

**New Types:**
- ✅ `SessionFormData` - Shared type definition for form state
  - Ensures type consistency across all form components
  - Includes all step data in a single interface

**File:** `frontend/src/types/sessionForm.ts`

### Backend Integration

**API Endpoints Used:**
- ✅ `POST /api/sessions` - Create new session with results
- ✅ `GET /api/sessions/:id` - Fetch session for editing
- ✅ `PUT /api/sessions/:id` - Update session details
- ✅ `GET /api/players` - List players for selection

**Request/Response Handling:**
- ✅ Request DTOs properly formatted
- ✅ Response parsing and type safety
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Loading states during API calls

## DDD & Clean Code Principles Applied

### ✅ Component Structure

1. **Single Responsibility:**
   - Each step component handles one part of the form
   - MultiStepForm handles only navigation and progress display
   - Page components orchestrate the flow

2. **Reusability:**
   - MultiStepForm is completely reusable
   - Step components accept props for flexibility
   - Shared type definitions prevent duplication

3. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - UI components separate from business logic
   - API calls isolated in api layer
   - Type definitions in dedicated files

### ✅ User Experience

1. **Validation:**
   - Real-time validation feedback
   - Clear error messages
   - Prevention of invalid submissions

2. **Data Preservation:**
   - Auto-save to localStorage
   - Draft restoration
   - No data loss on accidental navigation

3. **Mobile Optimization:**
   - Responsive layouts
   - Touch-friendly controls
   - Large input fields for mobile entry
   - Optimized navigation for small screens

4. **Visual Feedback:**
   - Progress indicators
   - Loading states
   - Success/error messages
   - Color-coded profit/loss

### ✅ Code Quality

1. **TypeScript:**
   - Full type safety
   - Shared type definitions
   - No TypeScript errors
   - Interface-based design

2. **Clean Code:**
   - Meaningful component and variable names
   - Small, focused functions
   - Consistent formatting
   - No linting errors

1. Navigate to `/sessions/:id/edit`
2. System loads existing session data
3. Form pre-populated with current values
4. Admin can modify any step
5. Submit updates
6. Success confirmation

### Flow 3: Draft Recovery

2. Enters data in steps 1-2
3. Accidentally closes browser
4. Returns to log session page
5. Draft automatically restored
6. Can continue from where they left off

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

1. **Result Editing:** Session editing currently updates session details only. Individual result updates require additional backend endpoints.
2. **Session List:** No session list view yet (planned for Phase 4).
3. **Session Detail View:** No dedicated detail page yet (planned for Phase 4).
4. **Validation:** No server-side validation feedback beyond error messages.
5. **Duplicate Detection:** No check for duplicate sessions.

### Planned Enhancements (Phase 4+)

- Session history timeline (Phase 4)
- Session detail view with full information (Phase 4)
- Session filtering and search (Phase 4)
- Session deletion with confirmation (Phase 4)
- Statistics dashboard (Phase 5)
- Leaderboards (Phase 5)
- Session analytics and charts (Phase 5)
- Export session data (Phase 9)
- Session comments and reactions (Phase 9)

## API Usage Examples

### Create a Session

```typescript
const request: CreateGameSessionRequest = {
  startTime: "2025-10-20T18:00:00",
  endTime: "2025-10-20T23:30:00",
  location: "John's House",
  gameType: "TEXAS_HOLDEM",
  minBuyInCents: 5000,
  notes: "Great game!",
  results: [
    {
      playerId: "uuid-1",
      buyInCents: 10000,
      cashOutCents: 15000,
      notes: "Had great hands"
    },
    {
      playerId: "uuid-2",
      buyInCents: 10000,
      cashOutCents: 5000
    }
  ]
}

const session = await sessionApi.create(request)
```

### Update a Session

```typescript
const update: UpdateGameSessionRequest = {
  startTime: "2025-10-20T19:00:00",
  endTime: "2025-10-21T00:00:00",
  location: "Downtown Club",
  gameType: "OMAHA",
  minBuyInCents: 10000,
